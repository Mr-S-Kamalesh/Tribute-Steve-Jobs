           <h2>Quotes from Steve</h2>
           <blockquote>
             “We donU+2019t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? And weU+2019ve all chosen to do this with our lives. So it better be damn good. It better be worth it.”
           </blockquote>
           <blockquote>
              “I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out whatU+2019s next.”
           </blockquote>
           <blockquote>
              "My favorite things in life don't cost any money. It's really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time."
           </blockquote>
           <blockquote>
              “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didnU+2019t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.”
           </blockquote>
           <blockquote>
             “Quality is much better than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles.”
